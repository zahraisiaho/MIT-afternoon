<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; color: cadetblue"><u>Introduction to Programming Languages</u></h1>
<p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages. </p>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #153f10"><u>HTML</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/Tim.jpeg" alt="" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="250" style="float: left">The <mark><i>HyperText Markup Language</i></mark> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #153f10"><u>CSS</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/CSS.jpeg" alt="" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="250" style="float: left"><mark><i>Cascading Style Sheets</i></mark> (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the <mark><i>separation of content and presentation</i></mark>, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px; color: #153f10 "><u>Java</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/James.jpeg" alt="" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="250" style="float: left">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>

<H2 style="font-size:30px; color: #153f10 "><u>Java Script</u></H2>
<p><img src="images/Script.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="250" style="float: left">JavaScript, often abbreviated as <i>JS</i>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a <MARK><i>high-level</i></MARK>, often<mark><i>just-in-time</i></mark> compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. </p>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #153f10"><u>Python</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/pyth.jpeg" alt="" width="251" height="201" style="float: left">Python is a<mark><i>high-level</i></mark>, <mark><i>general-purpose</i></mark> programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px; color: #153f10"><u>Kotlin</u></h2>

<p>Kotlin is a <i>cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level</i> programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps).Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.</p>
